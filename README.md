# Skilltracker

## Vision
A SaaS platform for real-time skill tracking, validation, and growth. Transform how developers, teams, and organizations manage competencies with live dashboards, API integrations, and practical evidence.

## Why?
Traditional CVs and skill checklists are obsolete. Skilltracker validates real skills using automation, project evidence, and peer review â€” driving real progress, not just assumptions.
